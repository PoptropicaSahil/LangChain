1. Start each day with a 20 minute jog. Focus on increasing the pace and distance every day.
 
2. Take a 10 minute break to stretch and catch your breath.

3. After stretching, find a hill or staircase to climb for 10 minutes. Go at a fast pace, taking as many stairs as you can in the time allotted. 

4. Do 10 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), alternating between a fast pace and a slow pace for the entire 10 minutes.

5. Take a 10-15 minute break to stretch and get hydrated.

6. Finish with an additional 20 minute jog, this time focusing on maintaining a steady pace and distance.

7. Stretching and cooling down are essential to ensure proper circulation and reduce risk of injury.
